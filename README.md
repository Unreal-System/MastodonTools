# MastodonTools
Use someone else's server's cache to restore your server's lost content!

Just go to download the source code of the current library and compile it

Then find a site from your Follower that has your cache, communicate with the other site in a friendly manner to get permission, and create an account at the other site.

Then create an application that should require at least the (read, read:accounts, read:search, read:statuses ) permissions

Then copy your access token, open this program, enter what the program asks for, and start recovering your data!

Why is the binary not released? Because it is limited by the size of the current dotnet full dependency, so it can only be compiled manually at the moment.
Don't mention PublishTrimmed to me, it's not officially released and I'm too lazy to test the stability of the cropped one.
