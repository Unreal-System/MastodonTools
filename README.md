# MastodonTools
Use someone else's server's cache to restore your server's lost content!

Just go to download the source code of the current library and compile it

Then find a site from your Follower that has your cache, communicate with the other site in a friendly manner to get permission, and create an account at the other site.

Then create an application that should require at least the (read, read:accounts, read:search, read:statuses ) permissions

Then copy your access token, open this program, enter what the program asks for, and start recovering your data!
